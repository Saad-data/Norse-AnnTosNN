#Norse AnnTosNN

#Overview:
Welcome to the Norse AnnTosNN Project! This repository houses a fascinating Jupyter notebook (norse_anntosnn.ipynb) that dives deep into the mystical world of Norse mythology. Our journey explores ancient Norse texts, using cutting-edge neural network techniques to uncover hidden insights and patterns.

#Features:
Data Exploration: Delve into Norse mythology texts with detailed analyses.
Neural Network Models: Implementation of advanced ANN models to interpret and predict patterns in the data.
Interactive Visualizations: Engage with the data through dynamic graphs and charts.
Comprehensive Documentation: Every step of the process is well-documented for ease of understanding.

#Installation:
To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

git clone https://github.com/Saad-data/norse_anntosnn.git
cd norse_anntosnn
pip install -r requirements.txt

#Usage:
Open the Jupyter notebook to begin your exploration:

jupyter notebook norse_anntosnn.ipynb

Navigate through the notebook, running each cell to experience the full analysis.
